Movement Composition Library

Go to https://aveturi.github.io/MovementTool for code documentation.

This tool allows you to "compose" complex 2d motion by chaining simple
2D movements together in configurable ways!

All your interaction will be with the Movement class.
There are 5 types of simple movements, I will call these "primitives" :
{Line, Curve, Circle, Wait, Sine}

Complex movements are formed by chaining primitives.

There are a bunch of examples under the Assets/Examples folder.
